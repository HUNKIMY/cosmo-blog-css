        <h2>Or ever was, or ever will be</h2>

        <p>
            <em>A generation ago</em>, the astronomer <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carl_Sagan">Carl Sagan</a> stood here and launched 
            hundreds of millions of us on a great adventure the exploration of the universe revealed by science.
            We're about to begin a journey that will take us from the infinitesimal to the infinite, from the dawn of time to the distant future.
            We'll explore galaxies and suns and worlds, surf the gravity waves of space-time,
            encounter beings that live in fire and ice, explore the planets of stars that never die, discover atoms as massive as suns and universes smaller than atoms.

        <h3>COMSMS IS ALSO A STORY ABOUT US</h3>
        <p>
            It's the saga of how wandering bands of hunters and gatherers found their way to the stars,
            one adveuture with many heroes.
            To make this journey, we'll need imagination.
            But imagination alone is not enough because reality of nature is far mikeorzenwondrous than anything we can imagine.
